Name: Siren

Description:
This is a 3D project of a siren, modelled by me in Fusion 360, which works like this: by moving the handle, the propeller moves inside the support and it creats 
a high-pitched sound. 
I chose this project because its very useful if it is printed, drawing everyone's attention to it. 
Furthermore, as its name says, its a good siren which can keep you protected from wild animals if you come in contact with them.

Project's main components:
-support back
-support front
-handle
-crank (made out of 2 components)
-handle connector
-2 big gears (with 28 teeth)
-2 small gears (with 4 teeth)
-proppeler(made out of 3 components)
-front propeller
-six big screws
-three small screws
-bullet

The project works by playing the motion study named 'principal mechanism', in which the joint between the holder connector and the back support is studied
 and it creates the whole mechanism move.

This repo contains .f3d, .stl, .mkv , .mp4, .txt .png files...

The software used to to designand render the mechanism is Fusion 360.
 
Project status:
Update 1. Created the project and decided the needed components.
Update 2. Created the back and front support, the front proppeler and some small screws.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Update 3. Created the propeller and the components of the mecanism.
Update 4. Corrected the components of the mechanism, created the bullet, the screws (the long and the small ones) and the handle with the crank. 
Added the joints and the contact between the components.
Finished!
